###Description

                

Given a set of candidate numbers (  
C  
) and a target number (  
T  
), find all unique combinations in   
C  
 where the candidate numbers sums to   
T  
. 
  


  
The   
same  
 repeated number may be chosen from   
C  
 unlimited number of times.
  


  
Note:  

  

  
All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.  

  
Elements in a combination (  
a  
1  
,   
a  
2  
, â¦ ,   
a  
k  
) must be in non-descending order. (ie,   
a  
1  
 â¤   
a  
2  
 â¤ â¦ â¤   
a  
k  
).  

  
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.  

  



  

For example, given candidate set   
2,3,6,7  
 and target   
7  
,   

A solution set is:   

  
[7]  
   

  
[2, 2, 3]
