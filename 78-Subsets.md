###Description

                

Given a set of distinct integers,   
S  
, return all possible subsets.
  

  
Note:  

  

  
Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.  

  
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.  

  


  

For example,  

If   
S  
 =   
[1,2,3]  
, a solution is:
  


  

[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
